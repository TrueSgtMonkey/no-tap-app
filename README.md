# No Tap App

# Overall Premise:
	This app will be a note taking app that will have a file directory on the phone that it is on. The app will keep track of what is in this directory, and the app will be able to export to different parts of the phone (with a save) and will also be able to load from different portions of the phone’s directory.

# Application Flow:
    1. App Start – Get views ready and other stuff
    2. Load in files from directory that app looks over.
    3. Display some sort of home page.
        1. If user sets an option to load in most recent document, allow them to do so
    4. The user can browse around the menu looking for different notes.

# Reason:
	Apps for taking notes on Android suck ass and lack features. Good apps fall off of the face of the Earth, so designing one for yourself will mean that whenever you think of a feature you need, you will have it.

# Design:
	There will be some sort of sidebar with different .txt files that the app is watching over. The user will click on the side bar when they want to open different files. Each file will be displayed as a page that has a text area and can be saved with some sort of other menu (maybe one on the right?). There will probably be a need for a full screen mode as well or a viewing mode in case the user only wants to view files.
